# Dotfiles
My configurations and dotfiles. 

## Setup
1. Run setup.sh. This will install all the required packages and symlink all the dotfiles to the $HOME directory and create a backup of the existing environment to $HOME/migrate.
2. Log out and log in again for all the changes to take effect.
3. Start emacs to install all spacemacs packages.
